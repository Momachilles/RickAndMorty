## Introduction

We are big fans of Rick and Morty and since we have some mobile development skills, we would like to develop an app allowing us to review every single character the TV show has.
Fortunately, there is a web providing all this information [here](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) (thanks, Internet).
The MVP would be to have an app where you can review a list of all characters and retrieve information about the selected character.

## Features

- You can use any library out there but use them wisely, each third party library added is a dependency in your code.
- Deliver something. We want to review how did you structure the project, if you apply things like SOLID.... This app will let us the chance to talk about actual code.
- We are a very image oriented company, UX is important.
- You can use any of the endpoints in [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/), we will talk about performance probably...
- Shine at some aspect. If you think your strongs are about code, we will spend most of the time talking about code despite the app won’t run.
- If you already have another app develop we can check, don’t spend time on this and send it to us. We will review it using the same criteria.

## Extras

- Be creative!
- Use Jetpack compose or SwiftUI
- Cache images coming from network to improve performance
- Error handling
- Response caching
- Implement tests
- Possibility to filter or search...
